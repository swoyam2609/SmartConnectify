# Healthcare Services in Odisha
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for an app that aims to address the issue of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in the state of Odisha. With an estimated 60% of all deaths caused by NCDs, the government is committed to providing free medicines and testing for these diseases. However, public awareness about the available services is low, causing many chronic patients to incur out-of-pocket expenses.

## Purpose
The app serves as a comprehensive resource for healthcare service delivery centers and facilities available to the public in real-time. The app lists the quality of healthcare services and tags nearby healthcare facilities, providing beneficiaries with the information they need to access the services they need. The app also has the potential to improve the consistency of the beneficiary base in government health centers and improve the overall quality of healthcare services available in the state of Odisha.

## Features
- Real-time listing of healthcare services and facilities available to the public
- Tagging of nearby healthcare facilities
- Quality rating of healthcare services
- Information about government health centers and their services
## Technical Stack
- Kotlin
- FireBase
